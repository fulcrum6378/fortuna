# Fortuna To-Do List

### 📊 Data Access & Analysis

* Line chart
* Make the loaded `Luna` in the `MainPage` stateful with non-array values?

### 📝 Data Entry

* Secondary Emoji? using '-' separators?
* Live saving for `VariabilisDialog`

### 🚀 UI Ease of Use

* Swipe to navigate
* An advanced touch navigation button which rolls the calendar using touch coordinates...
  Or rather keep rolling the calendar when the user hols the navigation icon buttons
* Jumping to other dates using other calendars
* Nostalgia: to remember what you did last year(s) this day!
* Replace an old emoji if a new one is entered

### ⚡ Performance & App Size

* Index `Luna`s as serialized in cache

### ✨ UI Aesthetics

* Changeable theme colour? Blue & Orange, Golden & Brown, Light Green & Gray
* Make the clear button reddish

---

## 📱 android-view

* Doesn't open the correct day on a new day and mingles months on a new month
* `VariabilisDialog` gets deformed when another app is in the pop-up mode above it

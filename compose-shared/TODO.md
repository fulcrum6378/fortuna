# Fortuna Compose To-Do List

* Make the loaded `Luna` in the `MainPage` stateful with non-array values?

> Java is the best ecosystem for Fortuna since it can abstract calendars and easily change between
> them. Otherwise I would've preferred developing a Qt application. Compose remains as the only
> proper framework for this application. Although it works too slowly on Android.

> Idea: A desktop UI in which you can easily scroll through years and months on sight
> and see everything in one place and its Variabilis is not a dialog but rather
> a changeable text area at the right side + a vertical coloured seek bar for pleasure and pain

> Since I found nobody in this world who wants to use this software except myself and my brother,
> and I can temporarily write in VITA files if I lose my smartphone for a while,
> and that my brother won't remain phone-less and scarcely uses his laptop,
> I don't think that a desktop version would be even useful at all!

> Add `fortuna.compose.version=3.1.0` on top of gradle.properties if you ever re-enable any of the
> Compose modules.

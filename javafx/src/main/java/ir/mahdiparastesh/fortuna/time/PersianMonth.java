/**
 * A month-of-year, such as Mehr.
 * <p>
 * {@code PersianMonth} is an enum representing the 12 months of the year
 * Farvardin, Ordibehesht, Khordad, Tir, Mordad, Shahrivar, Mehr, Aban, Azar, Dey,
 * Bahman and Esfand.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an {@code int} value.
 * The {@code int} value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,
 * from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum
 * rather than the {@code int} value to ensure code clarity.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code Month}.
 * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
 * <p>
 * This is an immutable enum and can be used in concurrent programs.
